## Overview

### The Challenge

From the [original Loopstudios challenge page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/loopstudios-landing-page-N88J5Onjw):

> Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
>
> This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!
>
> You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
>
> Your users should be able to:
>
> - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
> - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
